II. What Is Data Analysis?


Data Analysis
    A process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusion and supporting decision-making.

Why Python For Data Analysis:
    very simple and intuitive to learn.
    "correct" language.
    powerful libraries.
    free and open source.
    amazing community, docs and conferences.


When To Choose R:
    when R Studio is needed.
    when dealong with advanced statistical methods.
    when extreme performance is needed.

    
Data Analysis Process
    Data Extraction
        the process of retrieving raw data from diverse sources and converting it into a usuable format for analysis, storage, or integration (eg. SQL, scrapping, file formats, consulting APIs, buying data).
    Data Cleansing
        essential process of dinding and fixing inaccurate, incomplete, corrupted, or irrelevent datya in a dataset to improve its quality, consisgtency, and usability for abnalysis, business intelligence, and AI (Eg. missing values and empty data, data impotation, incorrect types).
    Data Wrangling
        the prcoess of cleaning, structuring, and teansforming raw data into a clean, high quality format that is ready for analysis and decision-making (eg. hierarchial data, handling categorical data, reshaping and transforming structured).
    Analysis
        proces of collecting, cleaning, transforming, and interpreting data to uncove useful information, idetify patterns, and support decision-making (eg. exploration, building statistical models, visualization and representations, correlation v. causation analysis).
    Action
        fact or process of doing something, typically to achieve an aim (eg. building machine learning models, feature engineering, moving ML into production, building ETL pipelines, etc.
